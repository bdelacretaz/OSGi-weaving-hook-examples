OSGi-weaving-hook-examples
==========================

Examples of OSGi WeavingHooks - logging method calls etc

Note that the code was built with Java 6 and doesn't currently compile with Java 7 and later. Patches welcome!

My experience of bytecode manipulation is quite limited, so that part of the sample is probably not very interesting, but it demonstrates the basic mechanisms of bytecode manipulation in an OSGi environment.
